            <h1>What is a Programming Language?</h1>
            <p>
                A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate
                with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to
                perform a specific task.
                <br>
                A programming language is mainly used to develop desktop applications, websites, and mobile
                applications.
            </p>
           <p><br>or <br></p>
            <p>
                Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer.
            </p>


            <h1>Types of programming language </h1>

            <h2>1. Low-level programming language
            </h2>
            <p>
                Low-level language is machine-dependent (0s and 1s) programming language. The processor runs low- level
                programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level
                language can be run very fast.
                <br>
                Low-level language is further divided into two parts -
            </p>

            <h3>i. Machine Language</h3>
            <p>
                Machine language is a type of low-level programming language. It is also called as machine code or
                object code. Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary or
                hexadecimal form (base 16) form. It does not require a translator to convert the programs because
                computers directly understand the machine language programs.

                The advantage of machine language is that it helps the programmer to execute the programs faster than
                the high-level programming language
            </p>

            <h3>ii. Assembly Language </h3>
            <p>
                Assembly language (ASM) is also a type of low-level programming language that is designed for specific
                processors. It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human-understandable form. It uses
                an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.
            </p>

            <h2>2. High-level programming language</h2>
            <p>
                High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and
                websites. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into
                machine language (execute the program).
                <br>
                The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain.
                <br>
                High-level programming language includes Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol,
                Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language.
                <br>
                <b> A high-level language is further divided into Two parts
                </b>

            </p>

            <h3>i. Procedural Oriented programming language</h3>
            <p>
                Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) language is derived from structured programming and based upon the
                procedure call concept. It divides a program into small procedures called routines or functions.
                <br>
                The advantage of POP language is that it helps programmers to easily track the program flow and code can
                be reused in different parts of the program.
                <br>
                <b>Example : </b> C, FORTRAN, Basic, Pascal, etc.
            </p>

            <h3>ii. Object-Oriented Programming language</h3>
            <p>
                Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language is based upon the objects. In this programming language,
                programs are divided into small parts called objects. It is used to implement real-world entities like
                inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc in the program to makes the program resusable, efficient,
                and easy-to-use.
                <br>
                The main advantage of object-oriented programming is that OOP is faster and easier to execute, maintain,
                modify, as well as debug.
                <br>
                <b>Example : </b> C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Middle-level programming language</h2>
            <p>
                Middle-level programming language lies between the low-level programming language and high-level
                programming language. It is also known as the intermediate programming language and pseudo-language.
                <br>
                A middle-level programming language's advantages are that it supports the features of high-level
                programming, it is a user-friendly language, and closely related to machine language and human language.
                <br>
                <b>Example : </b> C, C++, language
            </p>
